Hey there! I’m Reyna, a student currently pursuing a Master's in Computer Science. You know, for me, coding has always been about more than just writing lines of software. It’s about building things that actually make a difference. Ever since I started diving into tech, I’ve been fascinated by how the things we create can touch lives in ways we never expect. Technology has that potential. The things we once thought were impossible have now become reality, all made possible through innovation. 

I’ve always been fascinated by the stories behind groundbreaking technologies. The teams that started with just an idea and transformed it into something that touched millions of lives. When I think about my future, I want to look back and know that I was a part of something like that. That’s what fuels me and that’s the kind of work that excites me! And I guess you could say that this is the place (My GitHub) :) where I’m piecing everything together! Each project is a part of the bigger picture I’m working toward. Feel free to check out what I’ve been working on, and if anything catches your eye or sparks an idea, let’s chat!

And This is the less technical side of me, where I talk about the bigger picture, the things that drive me, and the journey I’m on. If you’re looking for more details on the technical projects I’ve worked on, the tools I’m familiar with, or just want to dive deeper into my work, feel free to check out my LinkedIn or explore my projects :)

So that's me in a nutshell! If you’re up for chatting tech, ideas, or just want to collaborate on something cool, hit me up. Let’s make something awesome happen!
